# Space Invaders Pygame Tutorial

## Project Description

### Motivation
This project is a tutorial that I followed on YouTube by freeCodeCamp.org in hopes to teach myself Python and simple animation/game development.

### The Idea
> * To build a simple single-player game that included a player and multiple enemies.
> * The enemies are controlled by the computer while the user controls the spaceship.
> * The user will use the arrow keys to control the movement of the spaceship (limited to only left and right movements) and will press the space bar to attack.
> * Each time an enemey is hit, the score will increase and the enemy will respawn to a different location.
> * The game will end when the enemies reach the spaceship.

### How This Will Be Accomplished
> * Languages / Tools / Libraries / Technologies:
>    * [Python Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) - The most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
>    * [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - An integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language.
>    * [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) - A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
